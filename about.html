                    Israel is a country in Western Asia. It is situated on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean
                    Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea, and shares borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to
                    the northeast, Jordan to the east, and Egypt to the southwest; it is also bordered by the
                    Palestinian territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively. Tel
                    Aviv is the economic and technological center of the country, while its seat of government is in its
                    proclaimed capital of Jerusalem, although Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem is unrecognized
                    internationally.

                    Inhabited since the Middle Bronze Age by Canaanite tribes, the land held by present-day
                    Israel was once the setting for much of Biblical history, beginning with the 9th-century Iron Age
                    kingdoms of Israel and Judah, which fell, respectively, to the Neo-Assyrian Empire (c. 720
                    BCE) and Neo-Babylonian Empire (586 BCE). Later rulers included the Achaemenid Empire,
                    Alexander the Great, the Seleucid Empire, the Hasmonean dynasty, and, from 63 BCE, the Roman
                    Republic and later Roman Empire. From the 5th century CE, it was part of the Byzantine
                    Empire, up until the 7th century Rashidun Caliphate's conquest of the Levant. With the First Crusade
                    of 1096–1099, Crusader states were established. Muslim rule was then restored in 1291 by the Mamluk
                    Sultanate, which later ceded the territory to the Ottoman Empire.

                    During the 19th century, the Zionist movement began promoting the creation of a Jewish homeland in
                    Ottoman Syria. Following World War I, Britain was granted control of the region by League of Nations
                    mandate, in what became known as Mandatory Palestine. After World War II, the newly formed United
                    Nations adopted the Partition Plan for Palestine in 1947, recommending the creation of independent
                    Arab and Jewish states, and an internationalized Jerusalem. Following a civil war within
                    Mandatory Palestine between Yishuv and Palestinian Arab forces, Israel declared independence at the
                    termination of the British Mandate. The war internationalized into the 1948 Arab–Israeli War between
                    Israel and several surrounding Arab states and concluded with the 1949 Armistice Agreements that saw
                    Israel in control of most of the former mandate territory, while the West Bank and Gaza were held by
                    Jordan and Egypt respectively.

                    Israel has since fought wars with several Arab countries, and since the 1967 Six-Day War has
                    occupied the Golan Heights and the Palestinian territories of the West Bank, including East
                    Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, though whether Gaza remains occupied following the Israeli
                    disengagement is disputed. Israel has effectively annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights,
                    While Israel has signed peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, and has normalized relations with
                    a number of other Arab countries, it remains formally at war with Syria, as well as Lebanon, and
                    efforts to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict have thus far stalled.

                    In its Basic Laws, Israel defines itself as a Jewish and democratic state, and as the nation-state
                    of the Jewish people. The country has a parliamentary system, proportional representation, and
                    universal suffrage. The prime minister serves as head of government and the Knesset is the
                    unicameral legislature. Israel is a developed country and an OECD member, with a population
                    of over 9 million people as of 2021. It has the world's 29th-largest economy by nominal GDP,
                    and ranks nineteenth in the Human Development.

                        alt="David Ben Gurion">
                    David Ben-Gurion ,16 October 1886 – 1 December 1973) was the primary national founder of the State
                    of Israel and the first Prime Minister of Israel. Adopting the name of Ben-Gurion in 1909, he rose
                    to become the preeminent leader of the Jewish community in British-ruled Mandatory Palestine from
                    1935 until the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, which he led until 1963 with a short
                    break in 1954–55.

                    Ben-Gurion's passion for Zionism, which began early in life, led him to become a major Zionist
                    leader and executive head of the World Zionist Organization in 1946. As head of the Jewish Agency
                    from 1935, and later president of the Jewish Agency Executive, he was the de facto leader of the
                    Jewish community in Palestine, and largely led its struggle for an independent Jewish state in
                    Mandatory Palestine. On 14 May 1948, he formally proclaimed the establishment of the State of
                    Israel, and was the first to sign the Israeli Declaration of Independence, which he had helped to
                    write. Ben-Gurion led Israel during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and united the various Jewish
                    militias into the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Subsequently, he became known as "Israel's founding
                    father".

                    Following the war, Ben-Gurion served as Israel's first prime minister and minister of defense. As
                    prime minister, he helped build state institutions, presiding over national projects aimed at the
                    development of the country. He also oversaw the absorption of vast numbers of Jews from all over the
                    world. A centerpiece of his foreign policy was improving relationships with the West Germans. He
                    worked with Konrad Adenauer's government in Bonn, and West Germany provided large sums (in the
                    Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany) in compensation for Nazi Germany's
                    confiscation of Jewish property during the Holocaust.

                    In 1954 he resigned as prime minister and minister of defense but remained a member of the Knesset.
                    He returned as minister of defense in 1955 after the Lavon Affair and the resignation of Pinhas
                    Lavon. Later that year he became prime minister again, following the 1955 elections. Under his
                    leadership, Israel responded aggressively to Arab guerrilla attacks, and in 1956, invaded Egypt
                    along with British and French forces after Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal during the Suez Crisis.

                    He stepped down from office in 1963, and retired from political life in 1970. He then moved to Sde
                    Boker, a kibbutz in the Negev desert, where he lived until his death. Posthumously, Ben-Gurion was
                    named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Important People of the 20th century.

                    Chaim Azriel Weizmann (27 November 1874 – 9 November 1952) was a Russian-born biochemist, Zionist
                    leader and Israeli statesman who served as president of the Zionist Organization and later as the
                    first president of Israel. He was elected on 16 February 1949, and served until his death in 1952.
                    Weizmann convinced the United States government to recognize the newly formed state of Israel.

                    As a biochemist, Weizmann is considered to be the 'father' of industrial fermentation. He developed
                    the acetone–butanol–ethanol fermentation process, which produces acetone, n-butanol and ethanol
                    through bacterial fermentation. His acetone production method was of great importance in the
                    manufacture of cordite explosive propellants for the British war industry during World War I. He
                    founded the Sieff Research Institute in Rehovot, Israel (which was later renamed the Weizmann
                    Institute of Science in his honor), and was instrumental in the establishment of the Hebrew
                    University of Jerusalem.

                    Chaim Weizmann was born in the village of Motal, located in what is now Belarus and at that time was
                    part of the Russian Empire. He was the third of 15 children born to Oizer and Rachel (Czemerinsky)
                    Weizmann. His father was a timber merchant. From ages four to eleven, he attended a traditional
                    cheder, or Jewish religious primary school, where he also studied Hebrew. At the age of 11, he
                    entered high school in Pinsk, where he displayed a talent for science, especially chemistry. While
                    in Pinsk, he became active in the Hovevei Zion movement. He graduated with honors in 1892.

                    In 1892, Weizmann left for Germany to study chemistry at the Polytechnic Institute of Darmstadt. To
                    earn a living, he worked as a Hebrew teacher at an Orthodox Jewish boarding school. In 1894, he
                    moved to Berlin to study at the Technische Hochschule Berlin.

                    While in Berlin, he joined a circle of Zionist intellectuals. In 1897, he moved to Switzerland to
                    complete his studies at the University of Fribourg. In 1898, he attended the Second Zionist Congress
                    in Basel. That year he became engaged to Sophia Getzowa. Getzowa and Weizmann were together for four
                    years before Weizmann, who became romantically involved with Vera Khatzman in 1900, confessed to
                    Getzowa that he was seeing another woman. He did not tell the family he was leaving Getzowa until
                    1903. His fellow students held a mock trial and ruled that Weitzman should uphold his commitment and
                    marry Getzowa, even if he later divorced her. Weizmann ignored their advice.

                    Of Weizmann's fifteen siblings, ten made aliyah. Two also became chemists; Anna (Anushka) Weizmann
                    worked in his Daniel Sieff Research Institute lab, registering several patents in her name. His
                    brother, Moshe Weizmann, was the head of the Chemistry Faculty at the Hebrew University of
                    Jerusalem. Two siblings remained in the Soviet Union following the Russian Revolution: a brother,
                    Shmuel, and a sister, Maria (Masha). Shmuel Weizmann was a dedicated Communist and member of the
                    anti-Zionist Bund movement. During the Stalinist "Great Purge", he was arrested for alleged
                    espionage and Zionist activity, and executed in 1939. His fate became known to his wife and children
                    only in 1955. Maria Weizmann was a doctor who was arrested as part of Stalin's fabricated "Doctors'
                    plot" in 1952 and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment in Siberia. She was released following
                    Stalin's death in 1953, and was permitted to emigrate to Israel along with her husband in
                    1956.[citation needed] During World War I, another sister, Minna Weizmann, was the lover of a German
                    spy (and later Nazi diplomat), Kurt Prüfer, and worked as a spy for Germany in Cairo, Egypt (then a
                    wartime British protectorate) in 1915. Minna was outed as a spy during a trip to Italy, and deported
                    back to Egypt to be sent to a British POW camp. Back in Cairo, she successfully persuaded the consul
                    of the Russian Czar to provide her safe passage out, and en route to Russia, she managed to
                    reconnect with Prüfer via a German consulate. Minna was never formally charged with espionage,
                    survived the war, and would eventually return to Palestine to work for the medical service of the
                    Zionist women's organization, Hadassah.

                    Weizmann married Vera Khatzmann, with whom he had two sons. The elder son, Benjamin (Benjie)
                    Weizmann (1907–1980), settled in Ireland and became a dairy farmer. The younger one, Flight
                    Lieutenant Michael Oser Weizmann (1916–1942), fought in the Royal Air Force during World War II.
                    While serving as a pilot in No. 502 Squadron RAF, he was killed when his plane was shot down over
                    the Bay of Biscay in February 1942. His body was never found and he was listed as "missing". His
                    father never fully accepted his death and made a provision in his will, in case he returned.[8] He
                    is one of the British Empire's air force casualties without a known grave commemorated at the Air
                    Forces Memorial at Runnymede in Surrey, England.

                    His nephew Ezer Weizman, son of his brother Yechiel, a leading Israeli agronomist, became commander
                    of the Israeli Air Force and also served as President of Israel.

                    Chaim Weizmann is buried beside his wife in the garden of his home at the Weizmann estate, located
                    on the grounds of the Weizmann Institute, named after him.
